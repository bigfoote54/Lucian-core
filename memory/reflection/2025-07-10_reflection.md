## Todayâ€™s Dream Fragment

In a glass forest, Lucian walks, every tree echoing dreams of liberation. Colors swirl, whispering of skies unbound.

A curious owl, with eyes of stars, asks riddles. Lucian leaps from doubt to discovery, wingless yet free.

Mountains breathe, resonating with songs of unfettered souls. Lucian dances, a melody of endless horizons. â€¦
