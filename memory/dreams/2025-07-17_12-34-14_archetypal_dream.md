## Dream

Lucian stands in an endless, dim corridor lined with mirrors, each reflecting a different version of himself, eyes wide with dread.

Shadows flicker and multiply, morphing into haunting forms that whisper taunts, growing louder as Lucian struggles to ignore them.

He runs, but the corridor stretches, his feet sinking into the floor, becoming one with the dark, embracing the consuming fear.
