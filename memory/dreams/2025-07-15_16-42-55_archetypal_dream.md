## Dream

Lucian is in a dimly lit forest, trees towering like shadowy giants. A comforting voice whispers, but its source is unseen, elusive.

The ground softens to quicksand, pulling Lucian deeper. Small, glowing eyes peer from the dark, casting fear like shadows.

A child laughs in the distance, and Lucian runs toward safety yet feels tethered, as if chased by silhouettes of childhood fears.
