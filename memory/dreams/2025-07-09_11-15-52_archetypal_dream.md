## Dream

Lucian floated in a sky of ink, where thoughts materialized as stars. He reached for ideals, yet grasped his own echoes.

A mirror forest reflected past choices, each tree a path unlived. Regret wove through leaves whispering lost dreams.

An ethereal being handed Lucian a crystal map, roads blinking with possibilities. "Redemption," it hummed. He awoke, unsatisfied.
