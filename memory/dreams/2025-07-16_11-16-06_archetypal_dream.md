## Dream

Lucian stands in a vast chessboard meadow, every square a different season. A white knight whispers of future victories promised in metaphorical battles.

In the sky, constellations shift into strategic maps, stars tracing paths to seemingly unreachable goals. Lucian floats, guided by ethereal currents.

A melancholic breeze carries echoes of lost games, yet every defeat shapes a ladder of perseverance. Lucian ascends, hopeful for arriving tomorrows.
