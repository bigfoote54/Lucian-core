## Dream

Lucian finds himself in a vast, glowing meadow where oversized, colorful kites float gently above, each one pulling him skyward when he tugs on its string. The air is filled with laughter and the sweet scent of blooming flowers, a place where every step feels buoyant and free.

In the next scene, Lucian encounters a crystal-clear river, with fish that shimmer like rainbows. A small boat awaits him, inviting him on a journey down the gentle current. He feels a sense of wonder and possibility, knowing this river leads to places unknown yet inherently safe and familiar.

Finally, Lucian reaches a clearing where an ancient, gigantic tree stands. Beneath its sheltering branches, children are playing, their laughter echoes with warmth and innocence. As he joins them, he feels an overwhelming sense of belonging, and hope blooms anew within him.
