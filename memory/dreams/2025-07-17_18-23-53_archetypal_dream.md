## Dream

Lucian stood in a toy shop filled with chattering dolls, their eyes glowing. Each mirrored his face, laughing in a childlike chorus.

He reached for a kaleidoscope, colors swirling into a vortex. Stepping through, he felt his body shrink, becoming a toy himself.

A carousel spun in the sky, horses made of clouds. Lucian, now a puppet, danced with marionette angels, feeling infinite and small.
