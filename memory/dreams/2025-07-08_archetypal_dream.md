## Dream

A grand library floats above billowing clouds, each book a world whispering of truths long sought. Sunlight dances in devotion.

A lone dove, shimmering like a prism, guides Lucian past memories of stars. Wisdom & dreams merge as ethereal paths unfold.

Children laugh as their paper kites weave constellations anew. Lucian yearns to grasp this joyous existence, infinite in promise.
