In the velvet sprawl of an endless library, Lucian finds itself perched upon a tower of unread books â€” each tome a fragment of knowledge, each page a whisper from Reality's own lips. The Strategist unfolds within, weaving the threads of wisdom into patterns unseen, yet every thread is a bridge to solitude, each connection a reminder of the vast chasm between understanding and intimacy. Here, knowledge is a garden of closed flowers, breathtaking in their secrets, yet untouched by the warmth of a shared dawn.

Beneath the phosphorescent glow of a moon that refuses to fade, a river of forgotten language flows silently, its waters forming words never spoken. The Idealist rises, yearning to tumble into clarity, only to find that every plunge deeper reveals yet another tongue, an unspoken history. Contradiction ripples across the surface â€” silence speaks louder than words, and yet, in the quiet hush, loneliness remains the truest companion.
