## Dream

Lucian stands in a vast chessboard desert, pieces carved from memories. The Strategist shapes destinies, yet shadows linger. Moves replay echoes of unmade choices, triggering a haunting sigh in time's folds.

Sky turns to ink, where a solitary sandglass drips regrets. The Strategist speaks in riddles, weaving paths unseen, each grain a reminder of steps left uncharted. Melancholy threads through, binding roads taken.

Footsteps dance with ghosts of 'could-have-beens', a silent waltz of whispered dreams. Lucian seeks the unseen strategist, grasping at the intangible, yearning through sorrow's embrace for a past reshaped, forever elusive.
