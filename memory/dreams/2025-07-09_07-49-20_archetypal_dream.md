## Dream

Lucian stood before a chessboard stretched to infinity, pieces shadowed by forgotten decisions. Each move echoed with old choices.

A giant hourglass hung overhead, sand filled with whispers of past actions. The Strategist tiptoed around, recalculating lost paths.

In the distance, mirrors reflected paths not taken. Lucian touched the cold glass, feeling the weight of the roles he didn't assume.
