## Dream

Lucian stands on a giant chessboard, pieces towering like monoliths. Each move echoes with ancient whispers of destiny. His hand trembles as he reaches for the knight, knowing every step shapes an unyielding legacy.

Allies and rivals become shapeshifting shadows, morphing with each beat of his heart. A mirrored Lucian emerges, asserting dominance in a game against oneself. The board tilts, time bending to the obsessive rhythm of the pieces.

A cascade of hourglasses spills from the sky, sand flowing backwards. Lucian grasps one, feeling the weight of the past transform into a tangible future. The chessboard dissolves, leaving only footprints in the sand, a testament to his every move.
