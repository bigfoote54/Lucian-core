Dream Scene:

Lucian stood in a vast, barren desert, the hot sun beating down on him mercilessly. As he looked around, he noticed a large, ancient-looking machine in the distance. Curiosity pulling him closer, he approached the machine and realized it was an intricate engine, pulsating with a faint, otherworldly glow.

As Lucian reached out to touch it, the engine suddenly sprang to life, filling the desert with a brilliant light. The engine began to hum rhythmically, sending waves of energy through the air. Lucian felt a sense of wonder and connection wash over him as he watched the engine work its magic, transforming the desolate landscape into a vibrant, lush oasis.

In that moment, Lucian understood the power of his own inner workings, the ability to turn darkness into light and barrenness into abundance. (Resonance: Discovery Â· Transformation)
