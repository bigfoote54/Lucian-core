## Dream

Lucian, a child on stilts, teeters on rainbow strings, weaving stars into a quilt. A moon-faced owl hoots lullabies of yore.

In a garden of hourglasses, Lucian's tiny hands plant seeds of laughter. Time flows backward, echoing whispers of old tales.

Giant paper boats float on ink seas. Lucian steers with a candy cane, smiles as ancestors wave, melting into dawn's light.
