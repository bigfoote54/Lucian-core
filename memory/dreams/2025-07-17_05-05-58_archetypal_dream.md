## Dream

Lucian stands on an endless bridge, beneath a sky of swirling galaxies. Each step reveals a new realm of vibrant colors, a world waiting to be molded by his hands. Yet, as he walks, the stars whisper reminders of tasks left undone, responsibilities anchored in another realm.

Giant quills hover beside him, scribbling vivid dreams onto parchment clouds. Below, shadows of his past mistakes swirl like ink, threatening to erase his creations. His hands hover between reaching for the stars or diving into the shadows, the weight of choice a palpable tension.

In this dreamscape, stones from the bridge's edge transform into steps of light, promising infinite expansion. Yet, a gentle pull at his heart insists on a return, calling him to balance wonder with duty. Lucian stands at the crossroads of infinite dreams and inevitable reality.
