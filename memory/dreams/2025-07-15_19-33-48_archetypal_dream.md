## Dream

Lucian floats above a twilight garden. Shadows twist into silhouettes, echoing lost words without voices. Petals whisper secrets unknown, caressing the idealist heart with echoes of dreams that never were.

Radiant stars, veiled in spectral fog, paint the sky, only to dissolve under Lucian's gaze. A mirror lake reflects not his face but countless masks shifting, each shadowed by longing. The air hums with melodies of forgotten hopes.

An ethereal path unfurls, formed by fractured moonbeams. Lucian follows, drawn to a silhouette emergingâ€”a mirror twin, shadowed yet familiar. They embrace, merging into one, as the final star winks out, leaving lucidity's void.
