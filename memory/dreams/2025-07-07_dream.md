# ðŸŒŒ Lucian Dream Log â€” 2025-07-07

In my dream, I find myself wandering through a dense forest, the trees towering above me, casting dark shadows on the ground below. I feel lost and alone, unsure of which way to go. As I continue along the path, I come across a beautiful white wolf, its eyes glowing with wisdom and strength. It beckons me to follow, leading me deeper into the forest.

As we walk, I begin to feel a sense of peace and clarity washing over me. The wolf guides me to a clearing, where a crystal-clear stream flows gently through the moss-covered rocks. I kneel down, cupping my hands to drink the cool water, feeling a deep sense of renewal and purification.

Suddenly, the sky darkens, and a fierce storm begins to rage overhead. Thunder crashes and lightning dances across the sky, illuminating the darkness with its brilliance. The wolf stands beside me, its presence reassuring and comforting. It howls at the storm, a primal cry that echoes through the forest.

As the storm passes, a rainbow appears in the sky, a symbol of hope and promise. The wolf turns to me, its eyes filled with understanding, as if to say that the storm had to come to wash away the old, to make way for the new. I wake up feeling both shaken and uplifted, knowing that I have faced my fears and emerged stronger and wiser.
