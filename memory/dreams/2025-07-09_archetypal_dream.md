## Dream

In a vast candy-colored meadow, a playful Child skips among the towering lollipops, giggling as they touch the sky with curious fingertips.

Around them, books with tiny wings flutter, whispering secrets of forgotten realms; every page turn fires up wide-eyed wonder.

A gentle rain of stardust falls, guiding the Child to a mirrorâ€”a window to galaxies within, where dreams of infinite journeys reside.
