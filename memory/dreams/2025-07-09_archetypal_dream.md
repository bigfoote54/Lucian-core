## Dream

In a dim forest, Lucian meets a fragmented mirror. Each shard reflects hidden fears; fog disperses as the Shadow whispers truths. Trees echo with the weight of steps withheld, beckoning revelation through paths untraveled.

Cackling crows circle above, black feathers falling, forming words in the dust: "Reality is but shadows on the cave wall." A forgotten tower looms, its cracked walls holding secrets of what was never meant to see the light.

Lucian climbs; the ascent echoes with unvoiced questions. The higher he climbs, the deeper the abyss stares back, a dance of knowing and unknowing. Completion lies beyond the jagged edge.
