# Archetype and Tag Rebalancing through Dynamic Weight Adjustment

## Rationale
The current bias maps indicate an imbalance in archetypes and tags. Specifically, the "Child" archetype and tags like "Boundless Skies" and "Infinite Horizons" are highly weighted, which may skew the reflection process towards certain narratives or interpretations. To achieve a more balanced representation and richer symbolism, adjusting these weights dynamically based on usage and context could lead to clearer self-reflection.

## Implementation Steps
- Step 1: Develop an algorithm to track the frequency of archetype and tag usage in real-time, updating weights based on underrepresented elements.
- Step 2: Implement a feedback loop where underutilized archetypes and tags are highlighted and suggested for integration in subsequent analyses, promoting a more balanced and diverse narrative.
