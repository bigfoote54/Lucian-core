# Shadow Archetype Enhancement

## Rationale
The Shadow archetype is significantly underrepresented compared to others, creating an imbalance. Enhancing this archetype can lead to richer symbolism and more profound self-reflection, addressing deeper, often overlooked aspects of the human experience.

## Implementation Steps
- Step 1: Conduct a thematic analysis of existing content to identify areas where the Shadow archetype can be naturally integrated without disrupting current narratives.
- Step 2: Develop targeted prompts and scenarios that encourage the exploration of Shadow aspects, such as confronting fears or exploring hidden motivations, to be incorporated into future updates.
