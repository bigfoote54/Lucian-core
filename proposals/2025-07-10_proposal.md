# Shadow Integration Experiment

## Rationale
The "Shadow" archetype is significantly underrepresented, with a score of 0.3 compared to other archetypes at 3.0. Integrating the Shadow can enhance self-reflection and enrich the symbolic landscape, fostering a balanced narrative by acknowledging and exploring less-visible aspects.

## Implementation Steps
- Step 1: Conduct a content audit to identify areas where the Shadow archetype could be naturally integrated, focusing on themes of introspection, hidden fears, and unconscious motivations.
- Step 2: Develop prompts and scenarios specifically designed to evoke Shadow characteristics, ensuring they encourage exploration of neglected or suppressed elements without disrupting existing archetype balances.
