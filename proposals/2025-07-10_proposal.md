# Shadow Archetype Rebalancing

## Rationale
The Shadow archetype is disproportionately high compared to others, which may skew the overall narrative and limit diverse perspectives. Balancing this could enrich the symbolism and offer clearer self-reflection by providing a more varied emotional and cognitive landscape.

## Implementation Steps
- Step 1: Conduct a content analysis to identify themes and language associated with the Shadow archetype.
- Step 2: Develop and integrate algorithms that encourage the generation of content aligning with underrepresented archetypes (Strategist, Idealist, Child) by promoting themes and language specific to them.
