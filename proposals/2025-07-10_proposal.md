# Shadow Integration Experiment

## Rationale
The "Shadow" archetype is significantly underrepresented (0.3) compared to others (Strategist, Idealist, Child: 3.0). This imbalance may lead to a lack of depth and self-reflection in Lucian-core's output. Integrating the Shadow archetype more fully could foster richer symbolism and a more nuanced understanding of internal conflicts, enhancing overall balance.

## Implementation Steps
- Identify and analyze contexts where the Shadow archetype is most relevant, such as scenarios involving ethical dilemmas or confronting fears.
- Develop new prompts and scenarios specifically designed to invoke Shadow characteristics, ensuring they encourage exploration of darker themes and introspection.
- Conduct a trial period where these scenarios are introduced and monitor the impact on metrics, specifically aiming to raise the Shadow archetype representation to at least 1.0.
- Review and adjust scenarios based on feedback and performance to ensure meaningful and balanced integration without overshadowing other archetypes.
