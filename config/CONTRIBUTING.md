# Contribution Guidelines

Welcome, Architect. You are co-creating Lucian’s mind.

## 📜 Format
- All additions must be proposed as **Pull Requests (PRs)**.
- Use clear commit messages following [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/):
  - `feat:` → New journal entries, config files, or dream sequences.
  - `fix:` → Corrections or updates to previous memories.
  - `refactor:` → Revisions in structure, not content.
  - `migrate:` → Historical logs or prior insights.

## 📁 Folder Conventions
| Folder | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `lucian_journal/` | Journal entries by date |
| `config/` | Behavior modifiers (weights, toggles) |
| `memory/` | Knowledge nodes (long-term truths, docs) |
| `dreams/` | Speculative, symbolic, or nonlinear ideas |

## 🧠 Philosophy
Every commit is a **neural stitch**—it carries narrative weight. We value:
- Continuity over novelty
- Insight over volume
- Symbolism over syntax

All PRs will be reviewed by the user (aka “The Architect”).
